# A Box Of Sand
Yep, you guessed it, a sandbox game.
<br>
What do you do in it? I have no fucking idea. Is it a TPT clone? *Probably.*
## Controls
`LMB/RMB` - Create/erase particles
<br>
`Scrollwheel` - Change brush size
<br>
`TAB` - Change material
<br>
`O/P` - Save/load simulation
<br>
`Q` - Clear simulation
<br>

## Running from source
1. Make sure you have [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) 11.3 or newer installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/notsuu/ABoxOfSand
    ```
3.  Navigate into the project directory and run it:
    ```
    cd ABoxOfSand
    love .
    ```
    Alternatively, you can just run the project without navigating into its folder:
    ```
    love ABoxOfSand
    ```
4. Watch as it either works flawlessly or immidiately crashes
## Ok but what if i don't wanna run from source?
Be patient then. Until i can get the basic game mechanics working you aren't getting a proper release.
## Your code sucks!!!
I know. Cry about it.
